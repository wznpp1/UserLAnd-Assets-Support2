Adventure is the original. What more can be said? This was the first adventure game; the whole genre is named after it. Ignoring the profound historical significance, it's a treasure hunt in a cave, like most of the early adventures. It has a verb-noun parser, minimal detail, two big annoying mazes, magic words, nonsense puzzles, and occasional death without warning. None of this matters. Enjoy!
